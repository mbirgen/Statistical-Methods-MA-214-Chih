# Statistical-Methods-MA-214-Chih

This space contains teaching materials that I developed in Fall 2022 that follow the material of Tien Chih. His work can be found
at https://tienchih.github.io/tbil-stats and pairs with his checkit problems found at https://tienchih.github.io/checkit-stats/index.html#/bank/. 
His home page is https://tienchih.github.io.

While I will do things differently next time I teach the course I found his work invaluable this semester.
