This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

* Exploration 2.5.1. Sum of Dice: Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
bluedierolls = sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 1000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6))
greendierolls = sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 1000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6))
diesum=bluedierolls+greendierolls
hist(diesum)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. The output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Run the following code to find the mean and variance of these die rolls
```{r}
mean(diesum)
var(diesum)
```
How do these compare with what you found on the worksheet?
